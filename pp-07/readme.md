# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742399.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: It is always important to consider all generation of users. In MyIIT finance page, it is important to keep in mind that it can be used by parents too. They wouldn't know which tab they should click to see some specific result. That is why my team decided to use drpdown menus that explains what it is in title and when user clicks, it will display all the data.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/navigation/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Considering same principle as above, it is hard to navigate in MyIIT page; especially when you are new to this website. I decided to use Flat navigation to make it relally simple and easier for users to navigate.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/first-launch-experience/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: When users launch MyIIT page, it looks kind of really busy and it doesn't focus on any specific thing and it is not responsive either. So my team decided to take out all extra stuff from main page and just add user pleasing image and login form.
